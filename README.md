# ME8-Containerization-and-Docker

This is the main repository for ME#8. Only branches made here will be credited as submissions for this activity.

## Instructions for submitting MEâ€™s through our GitHub Organization
Failure to follow the instructions above will result in your work not being checked. 
- From your local machine, create a new branch following the branch name format: SN_Surname_release (e.g. 198901213_Swift_release). This will serve as your submission repository. 
- For each activity, create a new feature branch following the branch name format: feature_activity## (e.g. feature_activity01). This will serve as your working repository. You may commit as many times to this branch as you want to backup your work in progress. 
- Once you are done with the activity and want to have it checked, create a pull request to your release branch with SA Harvey Dela Cruz as reviewers. Once we have checked your work, we will merge your commit into the release branch.

P.S. Since all of you will be working in the same Repository for each ME, please make sure that you only make changes to your own branches; DO NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THE MAIN BRANCH/OTHER STUDENTS' BRANCHES.
